### Hi there 👋

- 👨🏼‍💻 I’m currently working on **Ambit** app! This is by far my coolest project.
- 📱 If you want to see the app, simply do the following:
  1. Download **TestFlight** from Apple App Store from your iPhone
  2. Click this link: https://testflight.apple.com/join/vUpBiHa3
###### ...
- ⭐️ I've built some other cool projects, but I have to keep them private
- 💬 Ask me about the **Manufacturing Execution System** or the **Solar Design Configurator** that I built!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a hardware engineer and design printed circuit boards...but I fell in love with coding!
